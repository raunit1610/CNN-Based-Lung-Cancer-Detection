#### **Project Title**
Lung and Colon Cancer Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

---

#### **Project Description**
This project leverages deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer tissues. By automating the diagnosis process, it aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce human error, and provide a reliable tool for early cancer detection.

---

#### **Features**
- **Automated Cancer Classification:** Classifies images into distinct categories of lung and colon cancer.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved ~91% validation accuracy with robust metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Optimized Model Architecture:** Employs convolutional, pooling, and dense layers to extract and classify features effectively.
- **Preprocessing Techniques:** Includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model training.
- **Real-World Application Potential:** Designed to assist pathologists in early cancer detection and treatment planning.

---

#### **Dataset**
- **Source:** Histopathological images of lung and colon tissues, categorized by cancer type.
- **Format:** JPEG images, resized to 256x256 pixels for consistency.
- **Labels:** One-hot encoding for binary classification.

---

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV.
- **Framework:** Python for model development and data preprocessing.
- **Visualization:** TensorBoard for tracking training metrics, matplotlib for dataset insights.

#### **Model Architecture**
1. **Input Layer:** Accepts 256x256x3 images.
2. **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features using filters of varying sizes (3x3, 5x5) with ReLU activation.
3. **Pooling Layers:** Reduces dimensionality using max pooling.
4. **Dense Layers:** Combines extracted features for classification.
5. **Output Layer:** Softmax activation for multi-class probability prediction.

#### **Key Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy:** Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision:** Evaluates the ratio of true positives to predicted positives.
- **Recall:** Reflects sensitivity in detecting cancer.
- **F1-Score:** Balances precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides insights into classification performance for each cancer type.

#### **Implementation Steps**
1. Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
2. Splitting data into training and validation sets.
3. Building and training the CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. Evaluating model performance with detailed metrics.
5. Visualizing results using plots for accuracy and loss trends.
